## How to run my JavaScript files
My files are to run in the browser console 

### Here's how to run the code in the browser console:
Locate the JavaScript code you want to run (e.g challenge1.js).

Open the Browser Console:
  Chrome, Firefox, Edge: Right-click anywhere on a webpage and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element".
  Safari: Go to "Develop" menu in the top bar and select "Show Web Inspector".

In the developer tools window, find the "Console" tab.

Copy the JavaScript code you want to run and paste it into the console window.

Press Enter on your keyboard.
